# MonoGame Build Warning Tracker
This repository is a tracker for all current known build warnings for MonoGame.  You can track progress on the project board at https://github.com/users/AristurtleDev/projects/3

## Motivation
While a vast majority of the build warnings are for missing XML documetnation for public types, there are a few others for things like unused fields, or unnessecary attribute useages.  These are not errors and are not criticl bugs within the MonoGame code base, but it would nice to have them cleaned up and resolved so they aren't in the build logs.

## Help Needed
As you can see, there are 192 issues (at the time of this writing) attached to this repository to track the warnings.  While this is a lot, a vast majority of these are single files with a single warning for missing XML.  Even still, that's a lot to go through.

I'm calling for help from the MonoGame community in contributing to resolve these warnings.  If you are interested in assisting, please contact me in the [MonoGame discord](https://discord.gg/monogame).  I will add you as a collaborator on this repository and you can self assign which of the issues you want to work on so there's no cross effor being done by multiple people.
